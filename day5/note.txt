Phases of React Lifecycle (Detailed Notes)
React works in phases, which define how a component is created, updated, and destroyed in the browser.

In simple terms:
A React component goes through three main phases during its lifetime:
Mounting → Updating → Unmounting\

Mounting Phase (Component Creation)
This is the birth phase of a component — when it is first created and added to the DOM.
🔹 What Happens:
React performs the following steps internally:
Constructor() (optional)
render()
componentDidMount()

| Method                                     | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **constructor(props)**                     | Initializes the component, sets up state and bindings.                                                         |
| **getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)** | Updates the state based on props before rendering. Rarely used.                                                |
| **render()**                               | Returns the JSX that should be displayed in the UI.                                                            |
| **componentDidMount()**                    | Runs *after* the component is inserted into the DOM. Commonly used for API calls, DOM manipulation, or timers. |



MOUNTING PHASE — IN DETAIL
Definition
Mounting is the phase when a React component is being created and inserted into the DOM for the first time.

Initializes your component.

Sets up its state and props.
Calls lifecycle functions like:
In Class Components → constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount().
In Functional Components → useEffect() with an empty dependency array ([]).

useEffect() runs after every render by default,
but you can control when it runs using the dependency array ([]).
