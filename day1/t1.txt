what is React js ?
React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UI) — mainly single-page applications (SPAs).
It helps create reusable UI components and makes the UI update efficiently when data changes.

history :
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.

Key Features
Component-Based – Everything in React is built using components.
Declarative – You describe what you want to see, and React updates the UI automatically.
Virtual DOM – React uses a virtual copy of the DOM for faster updates.
Unidirectional Data Flow – Data flows in one direction (from parent → child).
JSX (JavaScript XML) – Lets you write HTML inside JavaScript.

Why React?
Before React, updating the DOM (Document Object Model) was slow and complicated.
React simplifies UI updates using a Virtual DOM and component-based architecture.

Benefits of Using React:
Fast – Uses Virtual DOM for efficient updates.
Reusable Components – Build once, use anywhere.
Easy to Learn – Based on simple JS concepts.
Huge Community – Tons of resources and libraries.

Components
Everything in React is a component.
A component is a reusable, independent block of UI.
It can be a function or a class.

JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX allows you to write HTML inside JavaScript.

React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, 
React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!
