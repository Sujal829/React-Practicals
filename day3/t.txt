HOw we can create boiler plate using tools
1 CRA(create react app )
2 vite (latest and recom)

1 CRA :
    - Tool created by facebook to help dev quikly start a new React Project 
    - It sets up evr.. for up
    - Webpack 
    - babel (Compiler or interpiler)(.jsx .js .ts )
    - babel -  convert modern js (ES6+) into backward compatible js 
    - command : npm create-react-app my-app

2. Vite:
    - It’s a modern front-end build tool created by Evan You (the creator of Vue.js) in 2020.
    - a newer and faster tool built by the creator of Vue.js
    - it also helps u start new r proj use diff approach thats make to much fater app lighte 
    - command : npm create vite@latest my-app

CRA VS Vite :
1. CRA uses webpack , webpack bundles your entire app before starting the server 
2. when u sav f , webpack rebuilds many parts again - slow ref

vite:
1 uses ES build and native browser modules
2 vite starts server instantly -> doesn't bundle Everything
3 compiles file uare currtly viewung 
4 Hot Module Replacement (HMR) — instantly updates code changes.


how create 
npm create vite@latest myapp
note : vite req node >v20.19+

Root folder : 

node modules    
    - supportive dependenciees are kept here(viet react , reactDom)
    - npm install command will install the package and unpack here 
    - Do not edit 

How to run app - npnm run dev
how to install pack - npm i 
how to inst spe pack - npm i <packcage name>


allow u to create 
- public:
    - stores static files (like logo icons )
    - static files not changable  - vite just copies 
    - 

- src:
    -/ assets /

        npm script dev build etc


/ package-lock.json / 11
